# Contributing Guidelines

## How We Plan to Work (for now)

### Branches
- Each team member will work on their own feature or bugfix branch, named using the format: `feature/<description>` or `bugfix/<description>`.
- Branches will be created from the latest `main` branch.

### Pull Requests (PRs)
- Changes will be submitted via pull requests to the `main` branch.
- PRs will require at least one team member's review before merging.
- Include a clear description of changes and reference related issues if applicable.

### Code Style
- Follow the existing code style in the repository.
- Use consistent indentation and naming conventions.
- Write clear, concise commit messages.

### Collaboration
- Communication will be done via team meetings and group chat.
- For Sprint 1, our focus is on understanding the codebase, starting to learn the required skills and recreating what the previous team had, just like Professor Parteek recommended when we met with him.
- Kanban boards and formal workflow tools will be introduced in future sprints.

### Learning
- Team members are encouraged to share useful resources and help each other learn.
- Document any new tools or processes that may help future contributors.
